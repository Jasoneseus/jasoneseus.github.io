            In Jim Jarmush' seminal film "Down By Law" three prisoners, in a momentary lapse of reason speaking in Babylonian tongues, 
            form a bond over repeating the phrase "I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!". Ice cream, 
            its figure in advertising and screaming children running to gather around the ice cream truck produce a 
            sense of community, all to a recognizable dinky tune. In Taiwan, this moment is reproduced in the management of waste: 
            rather than the indiscriminate beep-beep hidden by the morning fog, Taiwanese garbage trucks ring with beautiful simple melodies, 
            letting people know it is time to gather and dispose of their communal waste. Meanwhile, as internet platforms wage war over
            dominance of the access portal, we find ourselves as prisoners stuck conversing from bubbles, doomscrolling in the prison of 
            internet noise - down by law. We all scream for ice cream! explores the ice-cream model of Taiwanese waste management and the 
            ethereal apparition of community amidst the access portal war. As an audiovisual installation, it combines found social media 
            footage, waste and prison material to communicate the proposed narrative.

              <b><i>Carousel</i></b> is a holographic projection, depicting tattoo designs by Giuliano Bolivar on an animated carousel.
              I was commissioned to create the sound and music involved in this project. 
              This work was shown at the Apelbaum03 group exhibit: 'Queering the Gallery Week' April 2022 at Art Club Anomalie.

              <b><i>Onomy Onome</i></b> is a ~40 min. film shot in 2020/21. 
              Onomy Onome relays the abstracted events leading up to the rape of the main character MICHELLE. 
              I was the main sound technician for the project, involved with the recording and post-production, as well as 
              the composing of the score.            
    
              This film was conducted under the the no thing collective 
              to be featured on a large scale UV-Crystalized display as a holographic image.

            <p><b><i>The Squares Have Taken Over</i></b> was an exhibition hosted under the <i>no thing</i> collective in <i>De Vondelbunker</i>, 
              an autonomous cultural space in Amsterdam. The event was situated around a combined visual and sonic experience - 
              to encapsulate the dynamics how these can develop and shape the experience of the space during the exhibition.
              The music program was centered around arriving at 'the end of the world'. A live soundcape was created for the initial part of the exhibition, 
              and subsequently the DJ'ing and music choice increased in tempo and chaoticness; symbolising a loss of control.

              <b><i>The Score</i></b> was a planned sound installation organised by a research group on the emerging field of sound studies within the
              humanities. The exhibition was planned for an old unused basement within the Universiteitstheater, a building owned by the University of Amsterdam.
              This installation aims to steer the audience towards an awareness of the immediate situationality of their affective experience. That once one sets foot in
              the installation, one ceases to observe and becomes active and participatory to the experience.

            <p>          
              We do this by situating the sonic impulses in multiple aural spaces; by not explicitly marking all the elements that make this installation up; by simply having the tracks which play in all the speakers be of far longer duration than
              most audience members will likely spend their time in this installation space. The Sonic Impulses are made up of two tracks which play in speakers in
              separate corners of the room. While the pockets of sound, are found in boxes with speakers in them or in headphones.
