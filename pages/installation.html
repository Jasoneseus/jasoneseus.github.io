              A Friend To The Cyborgian Echo is an interactive installation which investigates the structural violence of AI, 
              hidden in SafeTensor files. Our novel approach transforms AI parameters into an immersive soundscape, resonating 
              sound and data through found objects and materials. Our objective is to invite the city it is located within into a 
              nuanced relationship with AI and the echo of its material reality. We aim to bring a critical dimension to the obscured practice of AI 
              through an understanding  of the Cyborgian Echo - a theory which does not attempt to purify but draws knowledge 
              from the interwoven nature of sound’s techno-cultural qualities.
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>What is a SafeTensor file?</i> An AI model exists in two parts: its architecture which determines the flow of information and its trained 
              parameters, which encode the learned representations of the input data. The trained parameters and basic 
              information about the model architecture are stored and shared as SafeTensors. But this is not the only thing 
              encoded in these seemingly harmless files. The process of training an AI model is far from a purely theoretical 
              or mathematical happenstance, although it may look that way. Training a model is rooted in a deeply material, 
              laboured reality. From data tagging camps in Nigeria, privacy infringement and illicit surveillance to the bare 
              extraction of raw materials, proxy conflicts over mining rights … - SafeTensors contain a hidden knowledge beyond 
              the data they were trained to represent. We recognise that between the data contained within the file is the violence 
              and blood of those that were exploited; being treated as simply ‘means to and end’, revealing how a technology which 
              is claimed to potentially save and bring humanity to a new frontier is built on injustice. <i><u>An echo of exploitation 
              resonates within these files - how can we expose this echo?</u></i>
              <br>
              <br>
              Sound researcher Annie Goh proposed the cyborgian echo as a theory dealing with technologically intertwined problems. 
              In her writing she reflects on the relatively new field of archaeoacoustics, which aims to understand the relationship 
              between people and sound throughout history. As an example, she notes how researchers have found that many cave paintings 
              in America seem to have been painted at positions where the most resonance, echo, and reverb is created if one were to 
              make a sound. Due to this correlation it brings up historical questions about these sonic qualities. To choose this location 
              for the painting implies the hearing of this sonic attunement, it implies that whoever drew this painting recognised an 
              importance of this space. Goh recognises that the echo in this case contains a god-like quality, beyond full cognitive 
              understanding but very much bodily recognised. This conception clashes with dominant Western philosophies of sound, which 
              conversely tries to isolate and purify sound. The echo has become an undesirable quality of sound in physical space. 
              By embodying the echo as a quality, what can listening and sound teach us about the world that we could not previously 
              understand? The echo in fact has a cyborgian quality, an intertwined and nuanced identity. Annie Goh says there are more 
              companions to the echo to be discovered. This project is such a companion.

                  This installation investigates whether a space can be heard as an organism: alive,
                  with its own inherent bodily rhythms and resonances. The corners of the room are
                  connected through a dialogue between two sets of microphones and speakers,
                  creating a feedback loop in which space is collapsed into itself. The resulting
                  resonance not only reflects the natural breath of the room, but also mirrors, enlarges,
                  and interacts with everything that happens inside; where objects, humans, and
                  sounds are its entangled organs.

              <b>Spatial Sound Workshop</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              When we engage with sound, we are confronted with its interconnected relationship to space. 
              Reverberation, refraction, and reflection not only communicate characteristics about sound itself, but also offer
              insight into the surrounding environment. This shared synergy is fundamental to our daily existence and interactions. 
              Taking up novel perspectives, the Spatial Sound Workshop – with its host, Ji Youn Kang – will examine the role of these 
              phenomena in shaping sound propagation. Can a diverse array of technologies help us unravel the intricate connections 
              between sound, space, and our sensory experience?
              <br>
              <br>
              In this site-specific workshop, participants will embark on an exploration of two distinct spaces in profound detail, 
              harnessing their potential as unconventional musical instruments. The scope extends beyond the boundaries of the physical, 
              delving into the possibilities of online realms. In both physical and virtual contexts, various tools such as microphones, 
              loudspeakers, and some basic programming will be utilised to discover the voices of these spaces and allow them to ‘sing 
              together’. The culmination of the workshop will be a sound piece, or a concert, presented at Zone2Source with all 
              participants that encapsulates the essence of the collective experiments.

                    Sing the Body Electronic is a musical project consisting of Amedeo Feingold and me; born from the concept of searching for warmth in the ghost of electronic music. 
                    Recognising the potential that this combination of improvisation, samples, and acoustic instrumentation can bring to sonic 
                    immersion. This theme of warmth is what helps guide our approach to sonic storytelling; how we convey and connect distinct 
                    musical movements into a larger narrative. Weaving these movements together with self-recorded samples and field recordings; 
                    these personal auditory snapshots bring an emotional connection and connect to the themes we are concerned with: namely human 
                    connection (family, friendship), imminent ecological consequences of human living, and the feeling of the overwhelming city 
                    existence.

                    <br>
                    The performance was recorded from a mixer straight into a Zoom H4n and mastered by Sing the Body Electronic.

                    <br>
                    For the setup, we used a Korg Minilogue XD, a fender stratocaster, a piano, a Korg Kaoss Pad, a Pioneer DDJ-400, 
                    a Beatsep Pro, and two computers running instances of Ableton Live 11, all of which was being fed into 
                    a multichannel Soundcraft mixer.

                  with AI and the echo of its material reality. We aim to bring a critical dimension to the obscured practice of AI 
                  through an understanding  of the Cyborgian Echo - a theory which does not attempt to purify but draws knowledge 
                  from the interwoven nature of sound’s techno-cultural qualities.

                    Shown at the <i>CTM / Transmediale Vorspiel</i> (February 2023) and at <i>MANIFEST:IO: The Symposium for New Media and Electronic Art</i> (February 2023)

                    <br>
                    In Jim Jarmush' seminal film "Down By Law" three prisoners, in a momentary lapse of reason speaking in Babylonian tongues, 
                    form a bond over repeating the phrase "I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!". Ice cream, 
                    its figure in advertising and screaming children running to gather around the ice cream truck produce a 
                    sense of community, all to a recognizable dinky tune. In Taiwan, this moment is reproduced in the management of waste: 
                    rather than the indiscriminate beep-beep hidden by the morning fog, Taiwanese garbage trucks ring with beautiful simple melodies, 
                    letting people know it is time to gather and dispose of their communal waste. Meanwhile, as internet platforms wage war over
                    dominance of the access portal, we find ourselves as prisoners stuck conversing from bubbles, doomscrolling in the prison of 
                    internet noise - down by law. We all scream for ice cream! explores the ice-cream model of Taiwanese waste management and the 
                    ethereal apparition of community amidst the access portal war. As an audiovisual installation, it combines found social media 
                    footage, waste and prison material to communicate the proposed narrative.

                    The auditory conception of this piece is composed of two main distinction sections: the soundscape of hyperfixated 
                    doomscrolling, and the soundscape of Taiwanese garbage trucks. The first section includes a compositional 
                    piece aptly called hyper, this piece is an imagined soundscape that would accompany this notion of hyper doomscrolling.
                    An accentuated and more intense form of scrolling which implies a potential future inevitability of how we will engage 
                    with these habits of algorithm consumption. The piece is played at 230 bpm, using elements of breackcore, taking samples 
                    from across the internet, using j-pop inspired chord progression as its baseline. These are broken up by sudden audio 
                    samples from the content being played on the screens, or by strange digital glitches and hiccups. Using corecore as an 
                    inspiration of how to approach this amalgamation of sounds and noises in a digital landscape. The soundscape of the 
                    Taiwanese garbage trucks is spliced together from a collection of found footage. They play 
                    midi-like versions of well-known classic compositions, such as Beethoven's "Für Elise" and Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska's 
                    "A Maiden's Prayer, turning them from their original compositions into jingles used to warn people that it is time to 
                    take out the trash. Through the repetition of these jingles, the harsh tones develop into a dream like wonder, 
                    becoming the soundtrack to a moment of ‘fresh air’ to move into a position where we are AFK from the online world. 
                    Developing into this concept of ‘sonic respite’, finding silence in noise which would normally be headache inducing, 
                    but by using it to filter other noise, it becomes a feeling of safety and respite.

                    Performance
                    <br>
                    Oosterkerk, Amsterdam
                    <br>
                    July 5, 2022
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b><i>Klanksneden</i></b> was an electroacoustic performance performed by <i>Interior Design</i>, an experimental electronic 
                    music duo consisting of Marcus van Esveld and me, in collaboration with <i>The Pulse Ensemble</i> choir and violinist 
                    <i>Yuri Shundyak</i>. It was performed at <i>De Oostkerk</i> in Amsterdam as a Ukraine Benefit Concert on the 5th of July 2022.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Compositionally, the idea behind Klanksneden was to create a dialectical narrative between the electronic sampling and 
                    synth sounds of <i>Interior Design</i>, and the acoustic sounds of the choir and the violin, in the context of the reverberation 
                    and resonance from the architecture of the church. The performance introduces the two elements of electronics and acoustic 
                    as harmonious yet separate, toying with subverting the expectations of what classically trained musicians would traditionally 
                    perform in these spaces, and the presence of this ominous electronic moving bass. Throughout the performance there was a blending 
                    and morphing of the electroacoustic, with strong points of harmony between the electronic soundscapes and vocal melodies, and 
                    other descents of a complete loss of tonality and coherence. Where within the context of the church, the sounds accentuate further 
                    in their potence and prominence. Culminating in a return to a particular traditionality through the vocal line, a common 
                    triumphant harmonious climactic return, with a deconstructed club-esque rhythm which loses itself in the resonance of the church. 
                    Using this narrative approach within our composition, it allowed for specific movements and overarching sonic landscape to be 
                    created, whilst still allowing for improvisation and musicality to play a central role in and between each movement.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    The performance was recorded on a Zoom H4n and mastered by <i>Interior Design</i>. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For our setup, we used a Roland TR-8S, a Korg MS-20 Mini, a Beatsep Pro, and we both used computers using Ableton Live 11 
                    software, all of which were being fed into a Behringer Xenyx X1622USB. Each member of the choir had a microphone which was 
                    fed through the mixer into a computer system, which were subsequentially manipulated using custom midi mapping with a Pioneer DDJ-400 on 
                    customised audio plugins.

                  Interior Design - EP
                  <br>
                  11 March, 2022
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b><i>Utopia was/is</i></b> is the debut EP from <i>Interior Design</i>, an experimental music duo consisting of 
                  Marcus van Esveld and me. This EP is a culmination of the initial creative and artistic explorations performed and 
                  condensed into four tracks. These tracks were all started and completed in <i>the attic</i>, the name given to the inactive 
                  machine room of the former NVWA (Nederlandse Voedsel en Waren Autoriteit), which is now a social housing project.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>The attic</i> was a nearly yearlong temporary project, in which we created a studio and working space within the broken 
                  and dormant machinery of the building, as a way of experimenting with how sound and the music we created was intrinsically 
                  linked to the space, opening up ideas of what spaces are, and how we utilise, visualise, and hear them. A remnant 
                  of the intent in which the building was created, and now remains largely unused. This symbiotic discovery of this 
                  location as our working space meant we were constantly uncovering new aspects of the room. Recognising the space as 
                  being vital for ventilation and electricity: an intimate insight into the organs of the building. Advocating for the 
                  potentially undervalued knowledge that listening brings.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We heavily incorporated the existence of <i>the attic</i> into this EP and our music. Recording the material elements of 
                  this space; the drone of machinery, the clangs of metallic objects, the beeps of electricity, and heavily sampling 
                  many of these elements throughout the songs. Throughout the process of creation we also interrogated and focus on 
                  listening as a form of knowledge production, as a form of communication and reception to the machine room, to inform 
                  the process of creation.

                  <b><i>Retrieved Overgrowth</i></b> was a commisioned sounscape audio piece for the exhibition <i>Of Other Spaces: Gardens of Dreams</i>. 
                  An exhibition organised by graduating students of the MA in Curating at the University of Essex.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The piece explores a sense of nostalgia that falls within the realm of ‘Anemoia’. Coined by John Koenig, 
                  Anemoia serves to describe the sensation of nostalgia towards an era never experienced by the individual 
                  feeling that nostalgia. The movements within the piece serve to represent control, overgrowth, and stillness 
                  within the ‘internal garden’. The piece begins with light, natural ambiance before being overtaken by a strong 
                  darker tone that uproots the previously delicate sound. As this subsides,the sound of rain returns the listener 
                  to a more neutral place, albeit grey by comparison to the beginning of the piece. Evoking the experience of hardship 
                  perceived through the mentally cultivated 'garden' space

                  <b><i>The Squares Have Taken Over</i></b> was an exhibition hosted under the <i>no thing</i> collective in <i>De Vondelbunker</i>, 
                  an autonomous cultural space in Amsterdam. an autonomous cultural space in Amsterdam. The event was situated around a combined visual 
                  and sonic experience - to encapsulate the dynamics of how these can develop and shape the experience of the space during the 
                  exhibition. The music program drew inspiration from this idea of arriving at 'the end of the world'. A live soundcape was 
                  created for the initial part of the exhibition, and subsequently the DJ'ing and music choice increased in tempo and chaoticness; 
                  symbolising a loss of control. The DJ’s would seamlessly transition into one another, all working together for a bigger whole, 
                  incorporating everything together for one large build-up with the inevitability of the apocalypse as the final confrontation. 
                  <br>              
                  <br>
                  The live soundscape composition was performed via an Ableton Live setup and played at the introduction of the event. Mixing pre-recorded samples 
                  and synth layers to reflect the movement of people entering the space, and their subsequent actions. Relaying a contemplative 
                  quietness while also playing with conceptions of fear and life in the presence of fear. Using the sounds of heartbeats, 
                  hospital-like machinery with synth low rumbles to create this interplay between the historical connection of this space as a 
                  bomb shelter, and the feelings of fear, life, and safety that this place would have contained. Where the rumbling of the trams 
                  which would pass above the space could be reframed as a part of the composition due to their vibrations, presence, and activation 
                  of the ceiling, walls, and architecture of the bunker.

              A celebration at the end of the world. A collection of PAINTINGS and complementary SOUNDS with a party to square the circle.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Squares Have Taken is an exhibition surrounding a mix of visual and sonic art which displaces objects and people to find confusion: exploring the moment of still velocities. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Niels Gercama will present a collection of visual works, including paintings, installations and mixed media; The work will be addressed with an introductory performance. Jason Clark shapes the space sonically to inform and engage the spectator; taking them on a journey. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The exhibition will later transition into a party, where DJ's will take the floor and turn the bunker into a union of music and dancing. Delivering a mix of banging and scattered house and techno, with some surprises thrown in between.

              <b><i>The Symphony of Valletta</i></b> is an audio documentary presented in four distinct movements, made as part of 
              Culture Lab at Amsterdam University College where we visited Valletta, the European Capital of Culture for 2018.
              <br>
              <br>
              Inspired by the genre of the city symphony which emerged in the 1920s as an experimental style documentary; an attempt to capture
              the ineffable spirit and characteristics of specific cities. As my first foreray into listening as a research practise I wanted to
              use the city symphony film as my guide for my movement throughout the city, to recognise Valletta through its urban soundscape. 
              This approach was necessary to critically engage with listening and sound recording, this was one of my first engagements with this
              type of practise, and that there exists friction between capturing the soundscape of a city and what sounds I gravitate towards as an
              active listener. By researching concepts of soundscapes through M Schafer and E Thompson, I wanted to actively move away from selective 
              and elitest conceptions of 'good' and 'bad' noise. The Symphony of Valletta is very much informed by my movement, as an individual 
              exploring notions of ethnography through sound recordings and listening.             
              <br>
              <br>
              The piece is one continious whole, presented in four movements: ocean, city, caves, finale. These movements combine soundscape 
              recordings, soundwalks, and interviews. Inspired by the idea of the symphony, I created a narrative where i could to engage with 
              presenting recorded sounds in the form of a composition. 'Ocean' situates the listener geographically on the edge of the city, where
              after a while a few minutes walk brings you from ocean calmness into the center. 'City' brings us into the historical center, 
              riddled with the sounds of tourists, information, construction, music where moments of sonic respite can be found within this chaos.
              'Caves' explores the massive underground network present beneath Valletta, whilst it is not fully publically accesible, certain underground
              spaces have been opened up, for tours or artwork. Much of this piece is centered around recordings from a Susan Philipsz sonic artwork,
              which explores the caves as being used for bomb shelters during the Second World War. To create a closer to this piece, 'finale' uses all the sounds from the previous movements in combination to create a wall of sound 
              in which the crescendo of the piece is reached. To recognise that all these sounds in combination are Valletta.  
              <br>
              <br>
              All sounds were recorded using a Zoom H2n over the span of two weeks, and edited together using Ableton Live.
