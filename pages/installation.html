              <b><i>We All Scream For Ice Cream!</i></b> is a video and sound installation by Niels Gercama and me. 

              In Jim Jarmush' seminal film "Down By Law" three prisoners, in a momentary lapse of reason speaking in Babylonian tongues, 
              form a bond over repeating the phrase "I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!". Ice cream, 
              its figure in advertising and screaming children running to gather around the ice cream truck produce a 
              sense of community, all to a recognizable dinky tune. In Taiwan, this moment is reproduced in the management of waste: 
              rather than the indiscriminate beep-beep hidden by the morning fog, Taiwanese garbage trucks ring with beautiful simple melodies, 
              letting people know it is time to gather and dispose of their communal waste. Meanwhile, as internet platforms wage war over
              dominance of the access portal, we find ourselves as prisoners stuck conversing from bubbles, doomscrolling in the prison of 
              internet noise - down by law. We all scream for ice cream! explores the ice-cream model of Taiwanese waste management and the 
              ethereal apparition of community amidst the access portal war. As an audiovisual installation, it combines found social media 
              footage, waste and prison material to communicate the proposed narrative.

            <p>
              <b><i>Klanksneden</b></i> was an electroacoustic performance performed by <i>Interior Design</i>, an experimental electronic 
              music duo consisting of Marcus van Esveld and me, in collaboration with <i>The Pulse Ensemble</i> choir and violinist 
              <i>Yuri Shundyak</i>. It was performed at <i>De Oostkerk</i> in Amsterdam as a Ukraine Benefit Concert on the 5th of July 2022.
              <br>
              <br>
              Compositionally, the idea behind Klanksneden was to create a dialectical narrative between the electronic sampling and 
              synth sounds of <i>Interior Design</i>, and the acoustic sounds of the choir and the violin, in the context of the reverberation 
              and resonance from the architecture of the church. The performance introduces the two elements of electronics and acoustic 
              as harmonious yet separate, toying with subverting the expectations of what classically trained musicians would traditionally 
              perform in these spaces, and the presence of this ominous electronic moving bass. Throughout the performance there was a blending 
              and morphing of the electroacoustic, with strong points of harmony between the electronic soundscapes and vocal melodies, and 
              other descents of a complete loss of tonality and coherence. Where within the context of the church, the sounds accentuate further 
              in their potence and prominence. Culminating in a return to a particular traditionality through the vocal line, a common 
              triumphant harmonious climactic return, with a deconstructed club-esque rhythm which loses itself in the resonance of the church. 
              Using this narrative approach within our composition, it allowed for specific movements and overarching sonic landscape to be 
              created, whilst still allowing for improvisation and musicality to play a central role in and between each movement.
              <br>
              <br>      
              The performance was recorded on a Zoom H4n and mastered by <i>Interior Design</i>. 
              <br>
              <br>
              For our setup, we used a Roland TR-8S, a Korg MS-20 Mini, a Beatsep Pro, and we both used computers using Ableton Live 11 
              software, all of which were being fed into a Behringer Xenyx X1622USB. Each member of the choir had a microphone which was 
              fed through the mixer into a computer system, which were subsequentially manipulated using custom midi mapping with a Pioneer DDJ-400 on 
              customised audio plugins.

              <b><i>Utopia was/is</i></b> is the debut EP from <i>Interior Design</i>, an experimental music duo consisting of 
              Marcus van Esveld and me. This EP is a culmination of the initial creative and artistic explorations performed and 
              condensed into four tracks. These tracks were all started and completed in the attic, the name given to the inactive 
              machine room of the former NVWA (Nederlandse Voedsel en Waren Autoriteit), which is now a mixed student / refugee 
              housing project.
              <br>
              <br>
              The attic was a nearly yearlong temporary project, in which we created a studio and working space within the broken 
              and dormant machinery of the building, as a way of experimenting with how sound and the music we created was intrinsically 
              linked to the space, opening up ideas of what spaces are, and how we utilise, visualise, and hear them. A remnant 
              of the intent in which the building was created, and now remains largely unused. This symbiotic discovery of this 
              location as our working space meant we were constantly uncovering new aspects of the room. Recognising the space as 
              being vital for ventilation and electricity: an intimate insight into the organs of the building. Advocating for the 
              potentially undervalued knowledge that listening brings.
              <br>
              <br>
              We heavily incorporated the existence of the attic into this EP and our music. Recording the material elements of 
              this space; the drone of machinery, the clangs of metallic objects, the beeps of electricity, and heavily sampling 
              many of these elements throughout the songs. Throughout the process of creation we also interrogated and focus on 
              listening as a form of knowledge production, as a form of communication and reception to the machine room, to inform 
              the process of creation.

              <b><i>Retrieved Overgrowth</i></b> was a commisioned sounscape audio piece for the exhibition <i>Of Other Spaces: Gardens of Dreams</i>. 
              An exhibition organised by graduating students of the MA Curating at the University of Essex.
              <br>
              <br>
              The piece explores a sense of nostalgia that falls within the realm of ‘Anemoia’. Coined by John Koenig, 
              Anemoia serves to describe the sensation of nostalgia towards an era never experienced by the individual 
              feeling that nostalgia. The movements within the piece serve to represent control, overgrowth, and stillness 
              within the ‘internal garden’. The piece begins with light, natural ambiance before being overtaken by a strong 
              darker tone that uproots the previously delicate sound. As this subsides,the sound of rain returns the listener 
              to a more neutral place, albeit grey by comparison to the beginning of the piece. Evoking the experience of hardship 
              perceived through the mentally cultivated 'garden' space

            <p><b><i>The Squares Have Taken Over</i></b> was an exhibition hosted under the <i>no thing</i> collective in <i>De Vondelbunker</i>, 
              an autonomous cultural space in Amsterdam. The event was situated around a combined visual and sonic experience - 
              to encapsulate the dynamics how these can develop and shape the experience of the space during the exhibition.
              The music program was centered around arriving at 'the end of the world'. A live soundcape was created for the initial part of the exhibition, 
              and subsequently the DJ'ing and music choice increased in tempo and chaoticness; symbolising a loss of control.

              <b><i>The Score</i></b> was a planned sound installation organised by a research group on the emerging field of sound studies within the
              humanities. The exhibition was planned for an old unused basement within the Universiteitstheater, a building owned by the University of Amsterdam.
              This installation aims to steer the audience towards an awareness of the immediate situationality of their affective experience. That once one sets foot in
              the installation, one ceases to observe and becomes active and participatory to the experience.

              We do this by situating the sonic impulses in multiple aural spaces; by not explicitly marking all the elements that make this installation up; by simply having the tracks which play in all the speakers be of far longer duration than
              most audience members will likely spend their time in this installation space. The Sonic Impulses are made up of two tracks which play in speakers in
              separate corners of the room. While the pockets of sound, are found in boxes with speakers in them or in headphones.
