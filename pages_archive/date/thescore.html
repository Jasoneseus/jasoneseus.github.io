            <b><i>The Score</i></b> was a planned sound installation organised by a research group at the University of Amsterdam, 
            organised by students from Cultural Analysis and Media Studies, on the emerging field of sound studies. The exhibition 
            was planned to be held in the  old unused basement found in the Universiteitstheater, a building owned by the University 
            of Amsterdam. Despite being in a complete state, the project could not be realised due to the emergence of the pandemic 
            and the temporary closing of the universities.

            The project was instead completed in the form of a descriptive written piece. Which can be read at the link below.
